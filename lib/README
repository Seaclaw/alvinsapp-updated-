Hi Sir,

I have programmed the code to only show the onboarding screen once and hence why once
the app is reopened it becomes a blue screen. This is not a technical bug but a feature.
I added this to make the onboarding process more realistic. 
If you want to retry the onboarding experience, you will need to:
1) Disable lines 21 and 22 in main.dart by adding //
2) Restart the program by running "flutter run"

I have disabled these two lines by default so you can repeat the onboarding multiple times. 

Regards.
